//A package in Java is used to group related classes and functions. Package is like a folder in a file directory
//package com.company;
public class Main //always file name=class name
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    //public static void main is a default function
    //void means it'll not return anything
    //from main function the program will be started to run
    //public-access modifier
    //static-for static keyword without creating any object we can run the code
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
//Basic structure of a Java program:-
//1) Functions:-
//2) Classes:-class has similar types of functions
